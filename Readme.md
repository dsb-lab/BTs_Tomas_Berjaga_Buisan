In this folder, you can find all the codes used to reproduce Tomas Berjaga Bachelor's Thesis results.
The different folders contain different files.

	const --> File with the constants and parameters used.
	utils --> Functions needed for simulations or analysis
	simulation/model/fig --> File to see the dynamics and results

Note that network simulations files are needed for some analysis and that the directories will depend on how
you manage and save files and information.
